Odin Recipes Project (Foundations Course).
This repo is a recipes project, as instructed in the Foundations Course of the Odin Project.
It is a practice of HTML5 basics, including an index/homepage and 3 recipe pages. All pages
have the HTML standard boilerplate. Titles/headers(H1, H2), paragraphs, ordered
lists, unordered lists, links, images & alt text are also applied. Use of basic commands on the CLI, git commands, and using VSCode was also practised.
