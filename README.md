Odin Recipes Project (Foundations Course)
This repo is a recipes project, as instructed in the Foundations Course of the Odin Project.
It is a practice of HTML5 basics, including an index/homepage and 3 recipe pages. All pages
have the HTML standard boilerplate, the use of titles/headers(H1, H2), paragraphs, ordered
lists, unordered lists, links, images & alt text. Use of basic commands on the CLI, git & Github commands, and using VSCode was also practised. I also learned and practised combining an unordered list with a link & typed text together.

NOTE TO SELF: HTML is easy and familiar so far, and I am getting used to commands like $ touch, mkdir, git add, git commit -m, pwd, ls -F, git status, code, cd in the CLI. However,I am sure there are many that I have forgotten like how to open the git commit message in VSCode. I need to go over old lessons on CLI again, as well as the lesson on git commands in case I've forgotten some of them. I also need to remember the exact way of writing out links (a href=) with typed text vs img src with alt text. I must also remember to commit to Github whenever a significant change is made and to type out a proper message explaining what has been changed (before I've already moved on and forgotten).
