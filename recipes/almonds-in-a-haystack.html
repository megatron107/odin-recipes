          <h2 class="headers">Description</h2>
          <P>
            A feat of awe and wonder. For example, I wonder if the person who was given
            the job of creating a recipe with Miracle Whip and came up with this had no eyeballs 
            or tastebuds? I wonder how many people actually made and tried to eat this monstrosity?
            We'll probably never know.
          </P>
        
          <p>
            Only brave souls with no gag reflex nor fear of heart disease need proceed
            to recreate and attempt to ingest this haystack-shaped hill of self-hatred.
          </p>
