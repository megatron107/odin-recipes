        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Here we have a fine example of the 1960s obsession with using moulds and making dishes
           in the shapes of other things - in this case, an igloo. Culturally inappropriate? Perhaps.
           Childish? Almost definitely. But if you are someone who likes to play with your food, dreams
           of visiting the Arctic, or just wants to get a fussy child to eat something, then this might
           be just the recipe for you.
        </p>
