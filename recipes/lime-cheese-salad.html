             <h2 class="headers">Description</h2>
             <p>
                A large, donut-shaped, bright green jelly dish that uses lime-flavoured, sweet Jello-O 
                mixed with vinegar & cottage cheese as a base and is then stuffed with indistiguishable brown 
                'seafood salad' (Prawns? Deep fried battered fish? The choice is yours!). So get out your 1950s
                jelly moulds, put some Frank Sinatra on the record player, and smoke a pack of camels to prepare
                yourself and your taste buds for this one!
             </p>

             <p>
                DISCLAIMER: The term 'salad' here seems to be used to refer to any mix of foods whatsoever and 
                should not be confused with the conventional use of the word 'salad' to refer to a dish made
                up of predominantly raw fruits and vegetables. i.e. Please do not confuse your doctor's advice
                to 'eat more salad' with consuming this abomination.
             </p>
